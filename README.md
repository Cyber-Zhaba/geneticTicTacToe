# Tic Tac Toe with Genetic Algorithm

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, with an AI opponent that learns to play the
game using a genetic algorithm.

## Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent.
- The AI learns to play the game using a genetic algorithm.
- The AI's performance improves over time as it evolves through generations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cyber-Zhaba/tic-tac-toe-genetic-algorithm.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe-genetic-algorithm
```

3. Run the game:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

After running `main.py`, the genetic algorithm will start evolving over 1000 generations. After the evolution is
complete, you will be able to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against the AI.
